1.0 Start
2.0 Read two number: num1, num2
3.0 Calculate the sum of two number, sum
         sum = num1 + num2
4.0 Calculate the difference of two number, difference
         If num1 is bigger than num2
              difference = num1 - num2
         Else
              difference = num2 - num1
5.0 If sum is bigger than difference
         Display the sum of two number, sum
    Else
         Display the difference of two number, difference
